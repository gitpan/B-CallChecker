NAME

B::CallChecker - custom B-based op checking for subroutines

DESCRIPTION

This module allows pure Perl code to attach a magical annotation to a Perl
subroutine, resulting in resolvable calls to that subroutine being mutated
at compile time by arbitrary Perl code.  The ops of the subroutine call
are manipulated via the B system.  Despite coding in Perl, the programmer
must be aware of implementation details normally only encountered in XS.
